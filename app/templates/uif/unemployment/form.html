            <!-- Adoption Benefits -->
            <h3 class="h4 fw-bold text-primary">Adoption Benefits</h3>
            <p>Application for Adoption Benefits must be submitted within 6 months after the court issues the adoption order. To qualify, the adopted child must be <strong>younger than 2 years</strong>, and only <strong>one of the adopting parents</strong> can apply for the benefit, which covers the time spent caring for the child.</p>

            <p>The benefit amount is calculated as the difference between any pay received from your employer and the prescribed UIF benefit rate, ensuring your total income does not exceed 100 percent of your normal salary. Your employer must declare any pay given during the adoption leave. Subject to available credits, benefits can be claimed for up to 365 days within a four-year cycle.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">

            <!-- Death / Dependants’ Benefits -->
            <h3 class="h4 fw-bold text-primary">Can I Claim If My Spouse Passed Away?</h3>
            <p>A surviving spouse or life partner must apply for benefits <strong>within 18 months</strong> from the contributor’s date of death. A dependent child may only apply if the spouse or life partner has not claimed within 14 days after the 18-month period ends.</p>

            <p>A child aged between 21 and 25 may also qualify if they are a student or learner and were <strong>wholly dependent</strong> on the deceased contributor. Subject to available credits, benefits can be paid for a maximum of <strong>365 days</strong> within a four-year period.</p>

            <p>Contributors may nominate their own beneficiaries for the death benefit <strong>only when there is no surviving spouse, life partner, or child</strong>.</p>
            <hr class="my-4">

            <!-- Benefit Amount -->
            <h3 class="h4 fw-bold text-primary">How Much Will I Get From UIF?</h3>
            <p>The calculation of benefit days is based on earning <strong>one day of credit for every four days worked</strong>. If you have contributed for four years or more, you qualify for up to <strong>365 days of benefits</strong>.</p>

            <p>For Maternity and Adoption claims, the maximum period payable is capped at <strong>121 days</strong>. The amount you receive is based on a sliding scale, calculated from a <strong>percentage of your previous salary</strong>.</p>

            <p>The total benefit amount is capped at approximately <strong>R65,000</strong>.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 fw-bold text-primary">How to Apply for UIF – Step by Step</h3>
            <p>You can apply for UIF by visiting your nearest Labour Centre or by submitting an online application through the uFiling portal. Before applying, consider estimating your benefit using UIF calculators such as those on <a href="https://uifcalculators.co.za">uifcalculators.co.za</a>. You will need essential documents such as your bar-coded ID, the last six payslips, and a UI-19 form from your employer. If applying online, ensure you first create an account on the uFiling platform at <a href="https://uifonline.labour.gov.za/uifOnline/loginJsp">uifonline.labour.gov.za</a> before submitting your claim.</p>

            <h3 class="h4 fw-bold text-primary">UIF Status Meanings</h3>
            <p>The initial statuses show the application's early processing stage. <strong>No Employee Found</strong> means your employer has not submitted your details, and you must contact them immediately. If the status shows <strong>Application in Progress</strong>, the UIF has received your claim and is verifying your documents. When it changes to <strong>Sent to Assessor</strong>, your documents are undergoing final review.</p>

            <p>Once reviewed, statuses such as Assessed (a decision has been made) and Approved (you qualify for payment) will appear. After approval, payment statuses follow: Payment Reserved means funds have been allocated, and Payment Processed means the UIF has released the payment to your bank, though it may take a few days to reflect.</p>

            <p>If your status shows Rejected, the claim was unsuccessful due to issues such as insufficient credits or late submission—but you may appeal. <strong>Submission for Continuation of Benefits (COB)</strong> indicates you have successfully submitted documents to continue receiving payments after the initial period.</p>
